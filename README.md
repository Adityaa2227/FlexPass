## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Coinbase Smart Wallet or compatible Web3 wallet
- Base Sepolia testnet ETH (for gas fees)
- Base Sepolia USDC tokens (for pass purchases)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd web3-micro-subscription-pass
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Configuration

1. **Smart Contract Deployment**:
   - Deploy the `FlexPass.sol` contract to Base Sepolia
   - Update contract addresses in `src/types/index.ts`
   - Verify USDC token contract address for Base Sepolia

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   VITE_CDP_PROJECT_ID=your_coinbase_project_id
   VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=deployed_flexpass_contract_address
   VITE_USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=base_sepolia_usdc_address
   ```

3. **Wallet Configuration**:
   - Ensure wallet is connected to Base Sepolia testnet
   - Get testnet USDC from Circle faucet
   - Fund wallet with Base Sepolia ETH for gas fees

## 📜 Smart Contract

The `FlexPass` contract is an ERC-721 NFT that represents flexible subscription passes:

- **Provider-based**: Each pass is tied to a specific service provider
- **USDC Payments**: Stable pricing with 6-decimal precision
- **Flexible Duration**: Purchase passes for any duration (rounded up to hours)
- **No Duplicate Passes**: Prevents multiple active passes per provider per user
- **Admin Controls**: Owner can manage providers and withdraw revenue

### Key Contract Functions

- `buyPass(providerId, durationSeconds)`: Purchase a new pass with USDC
- `extendPass(tokenId, additionalSeconds)`: Extend existing pass duration
- `revokePass(tokenId)`: Revoke a pass and mark as inactive
- `isPassValid(tokenId)`: Check if pass is active and not expired
- `getUserPasses(user)`: Get all passes owned by a user
- `getActivePassByProvider(user, providerId)`: Get user's active pass for provider
- `addProvider(name, logoUrl, hourlyRate)`: Admin function to add providers
- `withdrawUSDC()`: Admin function to withdraw collected revenue

## 🔐 X402 Access Control

The dApp implements X402 protocol for blockchain-verified API access:

1. **Pass Verification**: On-chain validation before each API request
2. **Payment Headers**: X-402-Payment headers with pass metadata
3. **Bearer Authentication**: Pass token ID used as bearer token
4. **Time-based Access**: Automatic expiration handling
5. **Provider Isolation**: Separate access control per service provider
6. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse

### X402 Implementation

```typescript
// Create payment header for API request
const headers = {
  'X-402-Payment': JSON.stringify({
    passId: pass.tokenId,
    provider: pass.provider.name,
    endpoint: '/api/chat',
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    signature: 'sig_123_456'
  }),
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${pass.tokenId}`,
  'X-Pass-Provider': pass.provider.name
}
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm run preview`: Preview production build
- `npm run lint`: Run ESLint

## 🚀 Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the `dist/` folder to your hosting provider:
   - **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo for automatic deployments
   - **Netlify**: Drag and drop `dist/` folder
   - **IPFS**: Use Fleek or Pinata for decentralized hosting

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Install Hardhat:
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
```

2. Configure `hardhat.config.js` for Base Sepolia:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    baseSepolia: {
      url: 'https://sepolia.base.org',
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Deploy and verify:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network baseSepolia
npx hardhat verify CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network baseSepolia
```

## Security Considerations

- **Private Keys**: Never expose private keys or mnemonics
- **API Keys**: Store sensitive API keys in environment variables
- **Smart Contract**: Audit contract code before mainnet deployment
- **Access Control**: Validate all on-chain data before granting access
